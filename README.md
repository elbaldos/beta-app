Beta distribuition in Bayesian Statistics
The plots in the app allow you to investigate the effect that the prior parameters and the data have on the posterior density in an interactive and easy way. It is also possible turning the point of view from the value p on the probability of prediction of the number of successes x, in both the cases before and after the observation of a champion of extractions.
